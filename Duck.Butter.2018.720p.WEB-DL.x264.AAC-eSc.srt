1
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,410
<i> You're the smartass</i>
<i>Duplass Brothers, aren't you?</i>

2
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,679
<i> How does the work break down?</i>
<i> What do you do?</i>

3
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,015
<i> All of our filming</i>
<i> happens right on the set.</i>

4
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:26,251
<i> -Very organic, in the moment,</i>
<i> like a therapy session.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

5
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,820
<i> We're improvising,</i>
<i> we're trying things,</i>

6
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,988
<i>we're getting upset and nervous</i>
<i>'cause it's not working.</i>

7
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,056
<i> We have a breakthrough.</i>

8
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,458
<i> "Holy shit!</i>
<i> This is so exciting!</i>

9
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,692
<i> It wasn't even in the script.</i>
<i> Let's go get it."</i>

10
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,794
<i> You know,</i>
<i> it's like the best version</i>

11
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,497
<i> -of what the scene could be</i>
<i> in this moment,</i>
<i> Right.</i>

12
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,899
<i> with the people we got</i>
<i> and where we're at.</i>

13
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,334
<i> We know what the scene</i>
<i> is supposed to be,</i>

14
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,636
<i> so let's just, like, see</i>
<i> what happens.</i>

15
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,372
Hi.
Hi.

16
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,408
Hi, I'm Naima,
I'm playing Natalie.

17
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,976
-How are you doing?
-Hello, good. How are you?

18
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,178
-Good. Welcome to set.
-Thank you.

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,414
Mark and Jay wanted
to talk to you before...

20
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,149
Yes, of course.
I wanna talk to them.

21
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,118
-Oh, thank you.
-Read this.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
-And you don't get anything.
-Yeah.

23
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,321
I feel like all dentists
are like that.

24
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,655
-Hi, guys. Hi. Sorry.
-Hey.

25
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,290
-Hey. Jay. Nice to meet you.
-How are you?

26
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,892
Naima. "Nima,"
if you can call me that.

27
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:07,993
Naima, thank you
for being here.

28
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,895
We loved your tape,
it was awesome.

29
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:13,265
Oh, thanks. I'm so glad.
I'm such a big fan
of you guys. I'm...

30
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,933
Yeah, I'm just honored
to be here.

31
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,368
We're huge fan of yours.
How's life? What's going on?

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,770
You know, I've been up
all night, just kinda...

33
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:19,771
getting ready for this.

34
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,140
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah.

35
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,008
-We're kind of like--
- We're pretty easy
about everything.

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,843
We can totally get something.

37
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,845
-Hey.
-Oh, hello, geniuses.

38
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,046
Hi, sweetheart.

39
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,281
These guys are
Lindsay and Kamal.

40
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,883
-Kamal.
-Naima. You can call me Nima.

41
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,050
-Hey. Lindsay.
-Nima.

42
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,519
Uh, welcome to the set.

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,354
So we were talking
and doing the scene yesterday.

44
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,756
-It just felt a little...
It was different.
-Yeah.

45
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,691
-It would be great to block
It was fuckin'
incredible.

46
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,360
with the onion rings,
don't you think?

47
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,694
-I know it's just like a prop--
-Onion rings?

48
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,329
Yeah, I think there was
onion rings in the scene.

49
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,797
It was kind of
specifically noted.

50
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,432
-Oh.
-I don't even remember.

51
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,201
I think we just learned
maybe the onion rings
aren't that important.

52
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,836
-Right, yeah.

53
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,438
This is the first time in life
that onion rings
aren't important.

54
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,908
-Right.
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,211
<i> There were a number of people</i>
<i> who wanted to talk to you.</i>

56
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,612
<i> Nobody wanted to talk to me.</i>

57
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,880
<i> Yes, they did.</i>

58
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,651
 And I think
there were, you know,

59
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,288
a lot of different things
going on tonight.

60
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,256
Tell me one...
What was the most...

61
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,424
Who was the cutest guy?

62
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,793
Okay. I know before we had
the whole thing,

63
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,995
where I was like,
you were pumped
that they went to the gay club.

64
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,165
It was a first time thing,
but, clearly,
things have changed,

65
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,901
and maybe less about
the onion rings?

66
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,304
 Yeah.
I think the thing
to remember is that

67
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,406
Kamal is crushed
when he comes in,

68
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,576
and you need to respond
organically to that energy

69
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,978
and let go of the old version
of the scene.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,379
I thought that...

71
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,548
all it took was me

72
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,818
to know I was gay,
and then I'd be gay.

73
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,787
But I don't know how
to talk to anyone. I don't--

74
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,754
Are you gay?

75
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,156
No, I think there were...

76
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,991
-Yeah.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,628
Yeah.

78
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,363
Okay, let's pause
for a second, guys.

79
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,298
-We're gonna pause real quick.
-We're gonna just come in
real quick.

80
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,833
Still rolling. Still rolling.

81
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,736
Well, just, while, like...
Um...

82
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,339
- Lindsay.
-Yeah, when Lindsay
is going to touch him,

83
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,774
if she makes it more clear...

84
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,409
-Right.
-...that she's hitting on him.

85
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,844
It's not really about her.

86
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,281
Your soulmate is coming undone
and you're here for him.

87
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,749
-Yes.
-Yeah, right?

88
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,286
And the more you can just be
an empathetic, open human being

89
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,221
that is receiving emotion,

90
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,459
that's all we need.

91
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,993
- He's in a great spot,
so once...
- Okay, okay.

92
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,101
 Everybody good?
Let's get quiet on the set.

93
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,536
And, Naima,
you're just chilling.

94
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,472
How many have you put down?

95
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,274
 I don't know,
but it is double figures.

96
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,541
 Yeah!

97
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,277
 Onion rings
without the onion
in the middle.

98
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,711
That's the worst part.

99
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,648
 The onion is where
all the calories are, by the
way.

100
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,716
I swear it's the secret spot.

101
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,819
Hi. How's it going?

102
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,553
Hey, what's up?

103
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,755
Is it okay if I join you guys?

104
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,023
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

105
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,358
Ah. 

106
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,362
Sorry it was a little
intense in there.

107
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,231
-No.
-Yeah.

108
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,801
I mean, it's just...
It's hard to get everyone
on the same page, you know?

109
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,070
Especially when it feels
like a little forced.

110
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,672
Mm-hmm.

111
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:10,075
I really feel like
with Kamal and, uh...

112
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,677
-Lindsay.
-Lindsay, right.

113
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,712
It's just that we have
very different acting styles,
I think.

114
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,347
We could, you know...
That's...

115
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,482
Talk about process and styles
and stuff like that.

116
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,284
I mean, at the end
of the day, you know,

117
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,586
we're happy with what
they're giving us,

118
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,155
-and it works for us.
-You are? Okay.

119
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,490
I mean,
all I can say is,

120
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,127
Jay and I were part
of a writers room one time,

121
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,229
and we got some notes
on our scripts,

122
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,964
and we went in and...

123
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,735
we told our showrunner
for an hour why he was wrong,

124
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:41,340
and why everything
he was telling us was idiotic.

125
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,576
And it didn't really
go well for us.

126
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,611
And we now realize
that we were probably being

127
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,114
a little defensive
and a little scared,
and that's okay.

128
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,350
I mean, we've kind of realized
that a lot of times

129
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,584
when you feel scared
or whatever,

130
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,088
you're actually right on
the precipice of, like,

131
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,889
an emotional breakthrough.

132
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,894
Yeah, I'm not...

133
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,331
I feel good.

134
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,801
I feel okay,
um, about it.

135
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,983
 I had never been
on a set like that,

136
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,752
'cause, like, on commercials,
it's not like that.

137
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,254
But, like, the way
that Mark and Jay work,
it was like very...

138
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,022
It was so collaborative
right away.

139
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,192
It just made me feel like,
"Oh, this is what
it's supposed to be like."

140
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,594
Do you feel good about it?
Like...

141
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,996
Yeah. I feel great about it.

142
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,598
Do you think I look okay?

143
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,299
Yeah, you look fine.

144
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,534
Have you been talking
to this girl?

145
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,803
Yes, we've been texting.

146
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,738
Saw each other on the Internet,
and you know...

147
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,706
Right. Naturally.

148
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,940
Of course. I mean,
it's all in the hopes

149
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,675
of getting into some kind
of relationship, right?

150
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,879
But then, you wonder, like,
"Who did they actually
vote for?"

151
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,814
-You know, are they--
-Please don't bring up the...

152
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,099
What?

153
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,383
Like, the world is going
in the shitter.

154
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,552
You don't wanna talk about
what's actually happening
in the world?

155
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,187
Not on my first date

156
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,989
-with this girl that
I'm hopefully gonna like.
-Do I have a rule book?

157
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,858
Can you give me a check book
of what I'm supposed
to talk about?

158
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,724
How you guys doing?

159
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,693
Give the man a big
round of applause.

160
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,463
Are you ready to party?

161
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,433
Okay.

162
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,969
I have to bring
this young lady up.

163
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,904
She's always bringing
her ass in here,

164
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,206
wanting to sing with us.

165
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,474
She's from Spain.

166
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,876
I'm gonna let her do
this one damn song.

167
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,346
And her name is Sergio.
with an "O."

168
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,089
Hi.

169
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,593
This is my first song
I've written all in English.

170
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,628
And it's the first time
I'm gonna sing it to you.

171
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,463
So I'm, like,
a little bit nervous,

172
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,298
but I think it's gonna be
so cool.

173
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,666
I hope you like it.

174
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,768
 Aw!

175
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,769
<i>  Bloom</i>

176
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,439
<i>  My boy says make room </i>

177
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,975
<i>  When the hand come</i>
<i> At the gloom </i>

178
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,444
<i>  When the arm comes</i>
<i> Creeping up </i>

179
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,145
<i>  I spread my arms so wide </i>

180
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,782
<i>  Assume that</i>
<i> That forfeits doom </i>

181
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,619
<i>  With the brightness</i>
<i> I resume </i>

182
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,821
<i>  And my broken leaves</i>
<i> On my branches </i>

183
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,924
<i>  Slips away</i>
<i> My blossoms bloom </i>

184
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,727
<i> Bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom </i>

185
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:53,532
Okay! Wait, wait, wait.
I get it.

186
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,536
Andre, do you think
that's working?

187
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,604
Uh...

188
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,573
Oh, she's the only one.

189
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,509
-You are the truthful girl.
-Yes, I am.

190
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,944
Thank you so much.

191
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,446
It's very hard to have friends
that tell you the truth.

192
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,016
Okay. Let's make a deal.

193
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,553
Which is, like, a singer
you will go crazy about?

194
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,720
Stevie Nicks.

195
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,622
Okay. Let's pretend
I'm Stevie Nicks.

196
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,558
You like that?

197
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,526
Okay, I'm gonna
come down right now

198
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,861
and kiss you.

199
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,629
Oh, no!

200
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,097
We have a date.

201
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,033
Should we do it?

202
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,468
Should we do it, yeah?

203
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,770
Let's go.

204
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,186
That was so beautiful.

205
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,956
 Whoo!

206
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:00,799
Come close, come close!
Come close, people!

207
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,046
Now, let's finish.

208
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,616
<i>  So I'm told</i>
<i> I've always been </i>

209
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,285
<i>  With flashing flood</i>
<i> And whipping wind </i>

210
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,554
<i> I leave with everything... </i>

211
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,960
It's ultimately a Ponzi scheme
that they created
for our environment.

212
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,128
-You know? Because--
 What?

213
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,664
Well, meaning that, like,
past generations,

214
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,899
-the amount of coal
that they burn,
-Yeah.

215
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,002
it costs more in the effects
of climate change

216
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,170
than it costs to get it
out of the ground to use.

217
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,505
 What?

218
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,040
It's just that all
our natural resources
were being used

219
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,142
in, you know,
you guys' heyday,

220
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,711
and now it's like
you took us out to dinner
and were like,

221
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:50,181
"Order everything you want.
Like, lobster tail, dessert,
it's on us."

222
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,651
And then you guys
snuck off to the bathroom
and never came back.

223
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,519
And, like, money
doesn't exist anymore.

224
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,354
-It was just a different time.
-But what's the solution?

225
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,590
After our natural
resources have gone,
it's just all gone.

226
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,724
There has to be a--

227
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,594
Jesus! You have a dark
view of the world.

228
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,429
-My God!
 I'm just saying.

229
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,264
New York City, it's like
all these buildings
that are so tall and beautiful.

230
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,466
But people are gonna be,
like, fighting for trees.

231
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,635
Hey, do you wanna
dance with me?

232
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,371
That sounds
like a good idea.

233
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,606
I'm a little bit...

234
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,241
That sounds like
the perfect idea

235
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,709
to get your mind off of the...

236
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:18,910
Come on, let's go dance.

237
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,745
 Go do it.
Shake a leg.
-Yeah.

238
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,480
 Come on, now.
Go shake a leg.

239
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,815
 Yeah.

240
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,450
-Okay.
Okay!

241
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,518
All right!

242
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,786
Can you guys watch
my jacket, though?

243
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,487
We'll watch your
natural resources over here.

244
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,955
Ha-ha! That's nice.

245
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,740
I'm Sergio.

246
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:52,310
Hi. Sergio, yeah.
I'm, I'm Naima.

247
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,244
You can call me Nima.

248
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,446
-Nima?
-Nima, yeah.

249
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,116
-You okay?
-Yeah.

250
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,226
I liked your show.

251
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,467
Maxine.

252
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,210
Wait, do you...
These were all your dogs?

253
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,612
Yeah, I foster them.

254
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,780
And then I find...

255
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,581
These are the final owners.

256
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,183
 Like, the happy owners?
-Yeah.

257
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,317
I love you.

258
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,886
Do you like dogs?

259
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,989
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're great.

260
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,157
It's okay if you don't.

261
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,591
 What happened
to your friend?

262
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,692
 She was
on a date, though.

263
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,894
-It was going well.
-Oh, cool.

264
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,495
Give me kiss.

265
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,365
Oh, I'm scared,
it went through my...

266
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,201
Five, four and go

267
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,036
<i>  Everybody's watching </i>

268
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,471
<i>  Go, we're judging you </i>

269
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,973
<i>  No pressure</i>
<i> Go </i>

270
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,143
<i>  The explosively talented</i>
<i> Go </i>

271
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,711
-We do this all the time.
-Yeah.

272
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,780
<i>  We barely know you</i>
<i> Go </i>

273
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,115
 Anything.

274
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:43,254
<i> I haven't been to the dentist</i>
<i>In over seven years </i>

275
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,857
<i>  But I think that's okay </i>

276
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,163
<i>  I feel truly superhuman</i>
<i> Every day </i>

277
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,498
 So good.

278
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:01,506
<i>  If I said right now</i>
<i> What I really meant </i>

279
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:06,044
<i>  I guess I'd fall</i>
<i> Right down the stairs </i>

280
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,346
<i>  And touch your head </i>

281
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:17,121
<i> I would really love</i>
<i>To touch your head right now </i>

282
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,626
<i>  I would really... </i>

283
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,027
 We weren't officially
together or anything,

284
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,329
but it just felt good.

285
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,799
And then, she kind of,
in one swoop,

286
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,968
was, like, pretending
like were just friends

287
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,170
who had never shared
this intimate moment.

288
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,706
Then I pulled back,

289
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,308
because I guess
I don't wanna get hurt
or something.

290
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,311
Susanna has always, um...

291
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,547
Who's Susanna?

292
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,714
-My mom.
-Oh, your mom. Right, right.

293
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,352
Um, she has always
said to me,

294
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,555
try not to go
for the easy thing.

295
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,192
Like, everyone is doing this,
why you should do the same?

296
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,227
And that works in love.

297
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,429
You can't play it safe in love.

298
00:14:58,632 --> 00:14:59,664
Yeah.

299
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,499
You have to just go
and tell them.

300
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,036
You know?

301
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,638
-You want food?
-No.

302
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,042
So I was dating this girl,
and after three years,

303
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,311
I find out
it was a waste of time.

304
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,646
So it was so fucked up.

305
00:16:55,648 --> 00:17:00,418
Like, why I spent
three fucking years
of my life with this asshole?

306
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,170
Right.

307
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,688
So Susanna one day
said to me,

308
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,856
"You know those kind of couples

309
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,124
that they spend, like,
ten years together

310
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,126
and then they get married?

311
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,494
They divorce in one year."

312
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,764
-Right.
-So just get married
right away.

313
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,466
Yeah, do everything you want,
the second you want.

314
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,768
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

315
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,069
I mean, you just get, like,
nervous thinking about it.

316
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,570
-before you do it.
-Exactly.

317
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,806
Just go and have fun
with the things
you have right there.

318
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,610
Yeah, like this.

319
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,778
This whole night.
We should do this
for, like, 24 hours straight.

320
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,114
-Like you and me?
-Yeah.

321
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,949
Eating chips, drinking juice.

322
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,718
-Yeah.
-Having sex.

323
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,555
Let's do it.

324
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,860
-Now?
-I wanna know you, for real.

325
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,695
You got four hours
out of me so far.

326
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,531
I want 24 hours.

327
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,700
And I wanna come with you
every hour.

328
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,635
Hmm.

329
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:51,702
Isn't it amazing?

330
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,970
It's like dating ten years.

331
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,073
Yeah, we're gonna get
to go to the bathroom.

332
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,407
Sometimes I'm an hour
in the bathroom.

333
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,909
-I want to see you
taking a shit.
-Yeah.

334
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,577
I want to see you
getting angry.

335
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,145
We can do it.

336
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,215
We can fucking skip time.

337
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,224
Um, yeah.

338
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,499
I just have to work on Monday,
so we can't...

339
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,533
We can't...

340
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,602
Actually, you know what?

341
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,171
For your art,
to be busy with life,

342
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,207
it's the best thing
you can do.

343
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,775
I know. But I feel like
our whole bodies

344
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,344
are gonna be
outta whack by then.

345
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,347
It's the biggest job
I've ever had, so it's just...

346
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,882
-I can help you.
-I have to...

347
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,952
I practice alone.

348
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,353
It's embarrassing.

349
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,589
I can't.

350
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,894
I just can't.

351
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,898
It's a fun idea, though.

352
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,337
But...

353
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,543
Next time.

354
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,679
Yeah.

355
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,478
Instead of going
through the format
of regular dating,

356
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,146
and faking it,
and texting and stuff,

357
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,649
you know, it'd just be, like,
we would just be there
all the time.

358
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,585
I kinda think
it would be an amazing way
to get to know somebody.

359
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,853
Hmm.

360
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,289
I mean, I think I was realizing
I was, like, I haven't...

361
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,090
said yes to anything
in so long,

362
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,126
especially with somebody else,
because, like,

363
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,894
no one is even close

364
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,547
to her.

365
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,498
It's like she lives in a way
that she doesn't question
anything about herself.

366
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,302
And when I was around her,
I didn't either.

367
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,538
You should ask her
to go get some coffee

368
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,940
-tomorrow morning and just--


369
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,341
Oh, shit.

370
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,742
Oh, it's my manager.

371
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,778
-All right, let's go.
I'm starving.
-Yeah, okay.

372
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,849
Okay.

373
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,618
Right. Yeah.

374
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah. Oh, wait.
It's transferring--

375
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,792
It's transferring
to a car coordinated--

376
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,127
Hello? Hey.

377
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,329
<i> Are you there?</i>
-Yeah, yeah.

378
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,830
Sorry. So, what were you saying?

379
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,215
<i> Maybe I'm...</i>

380
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,599
<i> Maybe I'm soft-pedaling it</i>
<i> for you,</i>

381
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,436
<i>but they're gonna replace you.</i>

382
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,371
What?

383
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,473
<i> I know. I feel horrible.</i>

384
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,342
<i> I know you were</i>
<i> so excited about this,</i>

385
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,611
<i> and, you know,</i>
<i> sometimes on the first day,</i>

386
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,880
<i> when it's just not right</i>
<i> on an indie, you can't...</i>

387
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,683
<i> There's no time,</i>
<i> and so they have to move on.</i>

388
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,087
<i> They don't love you any less,</i>
<i> but it's not gonna work.</i>

389
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,055
Okay, um...

390
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,691
I'll call you back.
Yeah. Okay.

391
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,727
It's okay. Yeah.

392
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:52,943
Hi.

393
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,114
It's me.

394
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:00,651
Sorry I didn't text
before I came over.
I just, um...

395
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,155
I was trying not to think
so much about it
and just come here.

396
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:08,125
Um, I needed to come
and say sorry

397
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,493
about what happened last night

398
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,296
and just, like, leaving
all awkwardly and...

399
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,998
You know, now I'm here.

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,534
We can hang out, you know?

401
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:20,338
Continue where we left off
and maybe even do the...

402
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,816
-Can I come in?
-No.

403
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,018
Okay.

404
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,986
 Yeah, I feel...

405
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,022
This is the first place I drove,
you know what I mean?

406
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,490
I was just like, I wanted to...

407
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,992
I'm working on the backyard.
You have to go around.

408
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,027
Oh.

409
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,596
 I know I fucked up.

410
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,764
But I'm here, I'm back.

411
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,566
I wanna stay up 24 hours
with you, 48 hours.

412
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,201
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

413
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,636
We've got to do it.

414
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,871
What was your breakfast about

415
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,140
to make you change
your mind like this?

416
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,008
I had a high protein breakfast.

417
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,143
Normally I just have sugar.

418
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,477
I'm serious.

419
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,515
What changed?

420
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,391
The truth is that
I've never actually

421
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,927
gotten close enough
to somebody to love them.

422
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,598
That's the truth.

423
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,837
So it's just new for me,
that's all.

424
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,473
But that doesn't mean
I don't wanna try.

425
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,876
You know, I felt finally free
for a second last night.

426
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:08,212
Like I was actually
being myself.

427
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,980
And I just wanna do that.

428
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,550
So when you feel free,
you just run away?

429
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:14,652
I have, yeah.

430
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,522
-Will you do that again?
-No.

431
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,124
-Promise?
-Yes.

432
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,462
Promise?

433
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,130
I promise.

434
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,601
Okay.

435
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,071
-Okay?
-Yeah.

436
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,943
It's just eight o'clock.

437
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,111
I arrived at...

438
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,180
near 7:00 p.m.

439
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,715
Mm-hmm.

440
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,016
Okay.

441
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,721
And sex every hour. Right?

442
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,892
-Can I touch you now?
-No.

443
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,988
-Hi.
-Hi, hi.

444
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,989
What's that?

445
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,657
It's a song that...

446
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,527
This is the song I want
to sing in the showcase.

447
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,928
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

448
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,565
Just-- You play piano?

449
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,367
Not really, no.

450
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,635
You were playing the piano.

451
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:38,936
I was just touching it.

452
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,438
You have to help me
with this song.

453
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,907
I know you can. I've heard you.

454
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,441
 Okay.

455
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,744
I don't know. I can't...
My ears aren't too good, but...

456
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,712
Mm. Liar. Come on.

457
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:53,217
<i>  Struggling within </i>

458
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:57,655
<i>  Quite a try and truth </i>

459
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:01,358
<i>  Oh, how long it takes </i>

460
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,194
 Too high? Yeah?

461
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,797
 That's good.
-Okay. So if I...

462
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,567
Come on, do it,
do it with both hands.

463
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:13,804
<i>  Maker of mistakes </i>

464
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:18,609
<i>  I prayed and I felt it </i>

465
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:23,814
<i>  Struggling with this </i>

466
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:28,419
<i>  Quite a try and truth </i>

467
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,486
Like, harmonize?

468
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,991
<i>  Oh, how long it takes </i>

469
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:35,793
 It's beautiful.

470
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,294
You have to sing
this song for me.

471
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,163
Okay.

472
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,664
Both of us together,
or aren't you singing?

473
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,899
No, you. Just you.

474
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,233
 Okay.

475
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,235
Okay.

476
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:52,910
<i>  Just back from the pill </i>

477
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:58,749
<i>  Trying out a new brand </i>

478
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,828
<i>  Oh... </i>

479
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:22,806
<i>  Our costume is so absurd </i>

480
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,184
<i>  Underneath the... </i>

481
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,023
<i>  New sign </i>

482
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,607
You have to suck this
right out of my body.

483
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,209
<i> Is Sergio</i>
<i> your real name?</i>

484
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:32,976
Yeah.

485
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,578
Why did your mom
name you Sergio?

486
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,814
She wanted a boy,
but I was a girl.

487
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:40,751
And then she thought,
"Okay, I'm gonna keep Sergio
in the middle name."

488
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,953
-Hmm.
-And when I was a kid,

489
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:47,024
and I wanted to have
Susanna's attention,

490
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,093
I took a shit.

491
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,962
-My shit was little shit,
because I was a kid.
-Sure.

492
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,697
And then I put this
little shit,

493
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,399
because my shits
were like this...

494
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,569
Yeah, and you cut it up
like a sausage or something?

495
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,670
Like a sausage.

496
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,238
So I put it on the floor

497
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,041
-and Susanna always thought
it was the dog.
-What?

498
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,958
Naima?

499
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,129
Look at me. Look.

500
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,401
You are so beautiful.

501
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,575
You're so, so...

502
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,547
so beautiful.

503
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,556
Say it.

504
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,526
Shout it.

505
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,364
Shout it to the fucking moon.

506
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,335
I can't.

507
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,469
Yeah, you can.

508
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,371
Say it to her.

509
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,042
-You have to say it with me.
-Yeah.

510
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:48,212
-I am so beautiful!
-She is so beautiful!

511
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,048
Stop being jealous!

512
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,083
Stop it!

513
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,725
The first time
I discovered masturbating

514
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,527
was on a sheepskin rug.

515
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,297
I would, like, rub up on it
while looking at myself
in the mirror.

516
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,634
I did the same with pillows.

517
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,769
-With pillows?
-Mm-hmm. With my cousin.

518
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,306
But then, her boyfriend
came and saw us.

519
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,141
-Really?
-Yeah.

520
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,144
Is your boyfriend still there?

521
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,448
He's still there.

522
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,861
 So my friend
had her third kid.

523
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,197
And I was like, "How can you
still be having kids?"

524
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,833
It's like, you know the world
that you're birthing them into.

525
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,801
I just think
it's really selfish.

526
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:50,240
This is the kind of stuff
you were telling these ladies
at the bar. Why?

527
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,309
 Why would somebody
have ten kids?

528
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,044
This thing is born
into the world,

529
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,879
and it's, like,
ruining their lives.

530
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,614
And they just pretend slowly

531
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,082
-Stop.
-that it doesn't...

532
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,919
Okay.

533
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,323
-Don't you think every parent
hates their kid?
-No.

534
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,392
People eventually
are going to be starving.

535
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,227
We have an end, you know.
There's an end.

536
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,596
So, what we can do
till now?

537
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,830
Get depressed about it?

538
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,232
I think I feel more
connected to people

539
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,700
when I feel like we're both
on the same page.

540
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,803
I think you depress people
when you're talking about that.

541
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,805
So I'm not supposed
to depress people?

542
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,273
I'm supposed to, like...

543
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,541
-make 'em happy?
-What do you think?

544
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,543
Every day I wake up
and I'm reading the news,

545
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,879
and it's just like one more
depressing thing after another.

546
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,213
What are you doing?

547
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:31,982
Are you doing something?

548
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,517
You can help Maxine.

549
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,352
I feel like I just want
to turn into a soldier,

550
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,387
where someone knocks
at my door one day and is like,

551
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,489
"It's over. Here's your weapon.
Let's go."

552
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,490
And I'd go.

553
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,258
But until then, I'm...

554
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,626
I'm knocking at your door.

555
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,794
 God, no!

556
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,728
Stop!

557
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,863
Stop. Let's be friends.

558
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:47,931
The war is not happening yet.

559
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,999
The people we--

560
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,634
Oh, my God!
That's so disgusting!

561
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,902
It's wet. It's hot.

562
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,270
It's wet. It's hot.
It's hot. It's hot.

563
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:56,707
Okay, baby. I stop. I stop.
Promise. Promise.

564
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:57,774
Seriously, stop.

565
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,209
Tell me, what is more scary?

566
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,744
The end of the world
or this shit?

567
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,245
Right now this shit,
right now.

568
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,350
Are there people back there?

569
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,454
Let's go and do it
in front of them.

570
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,521
 What?

571
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,757
-No.
-Yes.

572
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,258
We hide.

573
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,762
Okay.

574
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,368
Just act normal.

575
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,792
It's so good to see you.

576
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,460
Yeah,
it's been too long.

577
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,530
I thought you'd changed
your number or something.

578
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,932
No, I've just been so wrapped up
in work these days.

579
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,535
I remember
the last time I saw you
was at Jeremy's house,

580
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,505
when we did sake bombs
and then I threw up
on Cindy's jacket.

581
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:05,175
You always seem to be
very sociable.

582
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,943
I was just slutty is the truth.

583
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,712
But it's worked out for me now.

584
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,682
"Slutty"?

585
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,551
Sergio, I have to get one take.

586
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,221
Just because the boy
is saying to you
you're sociable,

587
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,357
you say you are slutty?

588
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,493
I mean, I don't...
It's not a good movie.

589
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,730
It's not a good movie
then why you wanna do it?

590
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,864
'Cause I need a job.

591
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,301
You should really do stuff
you wanna do.

592
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,670
If not, you are just
giving these people

593
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,672
just your talent for nothing.

594
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,841
You are giving a presentation
of who you are.

595
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,343
I think you should just
e-mail these guys
and tell them, "Look--"

596
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,511
I can't e-mail.
The last time I told--

597
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,580
-"You are a fucking
misogynist."
-No.

598
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,349
And just go and start
writing your own movie,

599
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,051
telling something
you have inside.

600
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,588
Recently when I told somebody
what I about thought 'em,
I got fired.

601
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,391
You got fired because
you said them what you thought?

602
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,026
Yeah. And I didn't think
it was going well,

603
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,861
so at lunch, I like,
talked to them about it,

604
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:58,962
and it just did not go well.

605
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,864
Okay, then fuck this tape.

606
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,265
Come, e-mail these guys.

607
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,534
-No, I have to do this tape.
-Really, I'm telling you.

608
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,169
You should e-mail
those guys who fired you

609
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,472
and tell them
why they are wrong.

610
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,842
I mean, they won't
take you seriously

611
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,543
if you don't say, "No."

612
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,879
They fired you.

613
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,882
They will never ever
hire you again.

614
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,785
So, what can you lose?

615
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,855
Yeah.

616
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,056
-Tell them!
-Okay.

617
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,091
So, okay. As an artist...

618
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,460
And I'm talking
to an artist too.

619
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,629
-As an artist speaking...
-To an artist.

620
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,798
...to other artists,
because there's two of them.

621
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,266
Other artists.

622
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:40,570
You know that the most
important is to be honest
with the work

623
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,205
The most important...

624
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,574
I want to be...

625
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,610
I want to work on movies

626
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,612
that respect...

627
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,615
-"I will make movies."
-...honesty.

628
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:52,482
I will make movies.

629
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,951
"And they will respect artists."

630
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,187
And they will respect artists.

631
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,256
"And then I will come
to your fucking door,

632
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,124
-and knock-knock."
-And then I will... Okay.

633
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,826
"Come to your fucking door
and knock-knock"?

634
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,394
Where does that one end?

635
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,795
"I'm gonna come to your door
and knock, knock," and what?

636
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,532
"And knock-knock to your door
and tell you..."

637
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,136
Fuck you?

638
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,071
-Yeah! Good!
-I mean...

639
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,341
"I will make movies.
Ones that respect artists.

640
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,978
And then I will come
to your door..."

641
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,713
All caps. "Knock-knock,

642
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,517
and say, 'Fuck you.'"

643
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,425
Okay.

644
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,896
-Should I send it?
-Yeah.

645
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,964
Wait, wait. No, no, no. Wait.

646
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,699
Okay. What are you gonna do?

647
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,367
-Record a sound.
Are you recording?
-What?

648
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,403
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

649
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,712
Send it, send it.

650
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,438
It's 2:00 a.m.

651
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,939
So what?

652
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,741
Means we have 17 hours to go.

653
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,278
 I once met
an older gentleman.

654
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,347
He was, like,
a respected writer.

655
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,816
I was a fan of his,

656
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:36,219
and we started e-mailing
and it was kind of
just like pen pals.

657
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,254
And they were kind of funny.

658
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,122
They were, like, dirty e-mails.

659
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,057
And then I was
in New York once.

660
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,694
Told him I was there
and he wrote back
right away, like,

661
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:47,497
"Come over to my house."

662
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,299
He opened the door
and he had this real fake,
slick air about him.

663
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,602
And he was kind of leaning
on the door, like...

664
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,404
"Come on in."

665
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,972
But in that moment I realized...

666
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,776
I had complete control
over him, you know?

667
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,179
And I remember his kids
were sleeping in the other room,

668
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,914
so we had to go
into the guest room.

669
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,683
But you were there
to fuck him?

670
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,885
I didn't decide,
but once I walked in, I was...

671
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,388
I was like, that's what's
gonna happen.

672
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,823
-Yeah.
-Like I was there
to deliver something.

673
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,459
In exchange of what?

674
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,529
It was like I wanted
his respect or something.

675
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,499
But definitely
didn't get it by...

676
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,035
having sex with him.

677
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,203
Yeah. Was it good?

678
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,505
No, it was terrible.

679
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:29,973
-Really?
-Yeah, it was really bad.

680
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,408
Fuck, that sucks.

681
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,677
He started to go
down on me and...

682
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,881
came up and he was like
disturbed all of a sudden.

683
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,449
He...

684
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,385
pretty much said that...

685
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,055
there is too much, like...

686
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:48,091
uh, smegma.

687
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,793
-It's gross. It's like...
-Soft?

688
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:52,162
Yeah, it's a little like
cottage cheesy.

689
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,463
Like<i> mantequilla de pato.</i>

690
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,065
<i> Manteqa de pato?</i>

691
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,066
<i> Mantequilla de pato.</i>

692
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:57,133
<i> Mantequilla de pato.</i>

693
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,802
It's like duck butter.

694
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,137
Duck butter.

695
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,373
-Duck. Quack, quack.
-Right, right.

696
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,808
-I like that better.
-So, what happened?

697
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,443
He didn't like that?

698
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,944
He didn't like my duck butter.

699
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:12,515
And so he kind of like
awkwardly stood up
and left the room.

700
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,384
You should send him

701
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:19,522
a box with a pint of
<i> mantequilla de pato.</i>

702
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,359
-Just like a gift wrap?
-Yeah.

703
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,860
A present for his kid.

704
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,528
They can eat it.

705
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,697
I'll say,
"Happy Thanksgiving." Yeah.

706
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:33,136
Duck butter for your kids.

707
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:39,809
So I wanted to do a record

708
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,578
and I had no money.

709
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
So I made a deal with this guy,

710
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:46,583
a very successful businessman.

711
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:50,286
"You pay for my record
for three months,

712
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,255
and then I can be
your girlfriend."

713
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,857
That was our deal.

714
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,794
And what'd you have to do
with him?

715
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:02,031
I lived with him,
I slept with him.

716
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,804
For three months.

717
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,009
And at the end,

718
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,011
he stopped paying
for my record.

719
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,581
-Oh, man.
-Yeah, I know.

720
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:23,153
So I tape him
having sex with me,

721
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,491
and then I said to him,

722
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,994
"Okay, if you don't pay
for my record,

723
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,465
I'm going to show this
to everyone."

724
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:37,967
So he paid.

725
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,337
Yeah.

726
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,640
And then you just
stopped it and left?

727
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,009
Yeah.

728
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,081
All right.

729
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,527
What's that?

730
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,762
It's my face.

731
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,665
 I love it.

732
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,874
I picture myself having sex
with a lot of people.

733
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,509
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

734
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,377
Like, with my friends.

735
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:23,746
-Mm.
-I think it's so hot.

736
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:24,547
Yeah.

737
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,634
-You okay?
-Yeah.

738
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,837
I think I've...
I think I've come too much.

739
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,939
We'll do it again.

740
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,643
Maybe I just need
a little break.

741
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,678
No problem. Don't worry.

742
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:18,968
You were sleeping like this.

743
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,272
-Yeah.
-Right? Yeah.

744
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,708
You are so sleepy.

745
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,110
-Yeah...
-Don't worry.

746
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,177
No, no, no.

747
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,882
Stop it! Seriously.
Stop, stop. Stop.

748
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,033
Fuck off.

749
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,347
You okay?

750
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,885
Yeah. I, um...

751
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,822
I don't really feel
so good. Like...

752
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,693
I just feel a little, um...

753
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,631
I don't know. I don't know.
 It's just...

754
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:23,399
Because of the sleep?

755
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,935
I think it was the combination
of the sleep and just...

756
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,637
staying awake.

757
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,439
I feel like I don't have
a lot, um...

758
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:32,775
a lot of brain power left to...

759
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,311
to even, like,
communicate anything.

760
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,579
It's because of me something?

761
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,114
It's because you're feeling
weird about me?

762
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:38,881
No, no, no.

763
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,450
But if you are, you can say it.

764
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,452
No, that's totally
not the reason, no.

765
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,820
What's going on, then?

766
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:45,822
You know...

767
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:48,691
I think it was just like,
you know, today it was like...

768
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,794
Like, I got fired earlier today,

769
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,429
and when I woke up...

770
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,797
You got fired today?

771
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,666
Yeah, this morning.

772
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,768
This morning you got fired.

773
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,403
'Cause you said recently.

774
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,875
Yeah.

775
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,649
So...

776
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,983
you got fired
and then you came here?

777
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:20,223
There was time in between,
but, yeah.

778
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,160
You came here
because you got fired.

779
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,564
No, that's not the reason
why I came here.

780
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:29,766
Yeah.

781
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:32,869
It is.

782
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,404
No.

783
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,140
No, it's not...

784
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,975
 It's not like...
I mean...

785
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:41,778
I found out this morning...

786
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,081
I think you should go.

787
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:48,284
-Now.
-Yeah.

788
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,538
This will cleanse us.

789
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,246
Why do we have
to stay up all night?

790
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:05,581
-We have to.
-Yes.

791
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,950
Are you close with your mom?

792
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,354
Yeah. We talked every day.

793
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,055
Yeah?

794
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,191
-She's coming.
-What?

795
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:16,893
She's coming for the showcase.

796
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,930
So I have to have breakfast
with her tomorrow.

797
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:22,765
-Oh, no.
-Today.

798
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,433
Right.

799
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,136
We were supposed to go
to the Seven tomorrow.

800
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,971
What do we do?
Do we break the...

801
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,907
Oh.

802
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:32,942
I don't know.

803
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:35,478
You will be there
in the showcase?

804
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,314
Promise? Okay?

805
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:40,683
Of course.

806
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,955
Susanna, when I was four,

807
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,823
we were in the street,

808
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:51,127
and I said to her
that I wanted normal mom.

809
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:54,030
And she said to me,
"Okay, just go and find her."

810
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:56,632
And she left me
in the middle of the street.

811
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,167
When you were four?

812
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:01,938
I spent the whole afternoon
trying to find the way
back home.

813
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,074
And then a neighbor found me.

814
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,143
And my mom said to me,
"Did you find her?"

815
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:08,978
And I was like...

816
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,952
And she said, "Good,
because I don't want
a normal daughter."

817
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:19,188
She said, "I don't want
a normal daughter"?

818
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,222
Yeah.

819
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,657
Whew.

820
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,328
How about your mom?

821
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:29,465
She's pretty like...

822
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:34,003
kind of strong, loud lady
from the Middle East.

823
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,404
She came over,
like, in the '70s.

824
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,707
But I got along better
with my dad.

825
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,042
Why?

826
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:44,347
She didn't really like the way
that I was like...

827
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,351
kind of a tomboy in school
and... I don't know.

828
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:52,621
Are you angry with her?

829
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:54,890
I think I have a lot of anger
with her, but I, like...

830
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:57,093
Have you talked
about that with her?

831
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:58,427
No.

832
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,530
Yeah, but that's inside.

833
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,666
This anger is there.

834
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,135
For a time.

835
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,106
Have you done meditation?

836
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,107
No, I haven't.

837
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:12,641
It kind of freaks
me out, you know.

838
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,011
-You do it?
-Yeah.

839
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,413
When I'm getting
anxious, like...

840
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,449
Like an anxiety attack,

841
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,953
I start thinking like a river
is crossing over me,

842
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:27,390
and I start describing
this river, and then...

843
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:33,696
I try to change the river
into a new river.

844
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,897
How is your river?

845
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,532
-My river is so brown.
-Oh, it's so chunky.

846
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,000
-It's brown...
-Yeah, I got brown, chop--

847
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,036
All the time, during that,
coming out of my...

848
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,071
Yeah, it's loud, it's choppy.

849
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,612
Okay, sit up.

850
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:51,747
Okay, you have your mom
in front of you.

851
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,215
-Okay, yeah.
-Just tell her

852
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,386
all the shit you wanna
make sure she knows.

853
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:02,491
Susanna, you're fucking crazy
leaving me at four years old

854
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,626
in the fucking street.

855
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:05,327
You're a fucking crazy mom.

856
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:06,262
For example.

857
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:07,696
Okay.

858
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,935
I think you're really angry

859
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,270
about how your mother
was to you

860
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:15,604
and you take it out on me.

861
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:18,207
And you're just a mean,
stupid bully

862
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:21,210
who teases
your innocent daughter.

863
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,711
Just go and tell her things.

864
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,380
I think you're jealous of me.

865
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,750
And that's why you're just
talking to me every fuck--

866
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:29,752
-You have to keep going.
-Right, right, right. Sorry.

867
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,923
I think you don't
take care of yourself.

868
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,025
-Yeah.
-You're super unhealthy

869
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:37,693
and you take it out on me,

870
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,595
and you blame me for not
being in better shape.

871
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,031
-You're a fucking narcissist.
-You smell disgusting
all the time,

872
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,799
and you blame me
for smelling bad.

873
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:47,903
Maybe you should be proud
about me for one fucking day.

874
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,205
You never accomplish shit.

875
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:52,141
And you never have
loved my dad ever,

876
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,143
and you pretended like
you have always,

877
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:56,078
and it's fake
and he doesn't like you.

878
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,780
You've never liked him!

879
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,181
Ever!

880
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,150
I'm never gonna have fucking
kids until you're dead!

881
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:13,129
-What time is it?
-It's like 6:00 something.

882
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,898
Susanna is coming.

883
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,366
Like, for breakfast?

884
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,603
This house is a mess.

885
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,009
Why don't we just...
Why don't we go to my house?

886
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,577
I have a bunch of food
at my house.

887
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,713
My house is like, clean,
like a hotel,

888
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,448
because I barely live in it.

889
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,150
What do you think?
Is that a good idea?

890
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:35,684
I can cook.

891
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:38,821
I go by my bike.

892
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,924
I'm following you.

893
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:42,925
All right.

894
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,495
Oh, my God!

895
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:47,863
 Whoa!

896
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:49,932
Okay, let go.

897
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,303
I'm gonna jump inside of you.

898
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:59,341
Sergio, no, no, no.
It's too close.

899
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,410
No, stay at least that far.

900
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,417
Oh, God. Oh, God.

901
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,354
Don't go inside.

902
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,890
Come on, open the door.

903
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,926
-That's enough.
-Open the door.

904
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,260
Just let me get the--

905
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:20,262
Oh, my God.

906
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:22,431
You live alone?

907
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,899
Yep.

908
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,739
It's so... big.

909
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,208
My dad got it for me.

910
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,443
He bought a lot
of real estate years ago,

911
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,845
and gave me and my sister
a house.

912
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,948
Are you judging me for having
such a nice house?

913
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,783
No, I want it for me.

914
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,818
Whoa, what's that?

915
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,888
It's a painting my dad did.

916
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,423
 It's depressing, right?

917
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,824
 I don't know.
I kinda like it.

918
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,060
I don't understand
how can you live with this.

919
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,261
I know, but I feel bad.

920
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,063
Like, my dad would feel sad
if it was gone.

921
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:58,167
You have to just take
this ugly stuff
out of your life.

922
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:00,102
This is what is wrong
with your life.

923
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,438
-Just take it off.
-Yeah.

924
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,040
Be careful. Sergio.

925
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,508
Whoa! Sergio.

926
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,211
-Whoa! Sergio. Sergio.


927
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,647
I guess I'm never having
my dad over again.

928
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,782
I don't care if it's
your dad's picture.

929
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,453
It's just depressing,
so just fuck it.

930
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:18,821
Burn it.

931
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,692
I feel, like, so powerful
in this place.

932
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,894
It's so white.

933
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:29,265
-We have, like, an hour.
-Yeah.

934
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,400
-Time to play.
-Okay.

935
00:56:57,782 --> 00:56:58,981
What?

936
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,456
Okay. It's okay.

937
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,891
What's wrong?

938
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,930
-Breathe.
-It's nothing.

939
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:18,967
I'm just tired.

940
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,472
-Sure?
-Yeah.

941
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,208
It's me. You can tell me.

942
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,715
Are we okay?

943
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:39,321
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We're okay, yeah.

944
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,824
I just... Yeah. I don't know.

945
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,159
I'm just tired.

946
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,628
Susanna is coming, you know.

947
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,234
-Yeah, yeah.
-Don't worry.

948
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,836
-It's okay.
-Okay.

949
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,475
-Okay, let's calm down.
-Yeah.

950
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,577
I'll take a shower.
You go cook something,

951
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,312
and then Susanna arrives.

952
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,413
Yeah.

953
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,782
Can you, can you be here
with me for that?

954
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,351
Sorry, I'll be okay.

955
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,353
-Okay. Sure?
-Yeah.

956
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:12,688
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

957
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,556
Yeah.

958
00:59:16,954 --> 00:59:17,886
Naima.

959
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,788
Do you have
another brush? Look.

960
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,391
The fucking brush
is broke.

961
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,059
Look at that.

962
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,460
It's fucking broken.

963
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,396
Here. Stop, stop, stop.

964
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:30,065
Hold it so it doesn't...

965
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,502
Sorry, I thought I had
more breakfasty food.

966
00:59:33,504 --> 00:59:36,071
I'm making, like,
gnocchi and salad.

967
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,839
You think Susanne
is gonna eat this?

968
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,377
It's like potato.

969
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:45,747
-And I have a pesto sauce.
-Yeah, I know what is gnocchi.
I know.

970
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,553
Is she gonna be okay
with just having some
random grub here?

971
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:52,988
She's coming over
to a stranger's house.

972
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,222
She doesn't know me
or anything.

973
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,390
No, no. She's so cool.

974
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,792
She's so good with everything.

975
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,927
She just deals with everything.

976
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,698
Fuck!

977
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,386
What's that?

978
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:28,323
-Hmm?
-Music.

979
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,325
It's this song called...

980
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,594
"Ah! Sweet Mystery Of Life."

981
01:00:32,596 --> 01:00:34,730
It's a like really old
1920s song,

982
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,331
but covered by...

983
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:39,067
-Cover?
-Yeah.

984
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,803
But the first version sounds
a little different than this.

985
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,745
You don't like it?

986
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52,247
I don't do covers.

987
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,782
You don't do covers?

988
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,817
No.

989
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,919
People who does covers
they're just doing

990
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,022
bullshit copying someone else.

991
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:05,027
-What about Elvis?
-What?

992
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,162
Almost every song
he did was a cover.
The fact that his...

993
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,231
The way he sang those songs
had nothing to do

994
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:10,399
with how beautiful they were.

995
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,367
If anyone else sang it,
they wouldn't be good songs.

996
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,604
And, yeah,
he's an interpreter,
not an artist.

997
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:17,639
Beatles were creating
something new.

998
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,708
Not fucking Elvis.

999
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,077
-Do you have wine?
-Yes.

1000
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,413
Do you have water?

1001
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,214
Yes.

1002
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:31,920
We'll have to fill it up.

1003
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,856
Uh...

1004
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,361
What? What's missing?

1005
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:42,631
That's it, right? That's it.

1006
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,433
I mean, what else--
Yeah, it looks great.

1007
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:45,834
Yeah, yeah.

1008
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,038
Okay.

1009
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,774
You know, we haven't had sex
in, like, two and a half hours.

1010
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:07,622
<i> Hola.</i>

1011
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,598
-Hi.
-She's Naima.

1012
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,767
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

1013
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,296
You will love it.

1014
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,934
Have you heard any
of her latest songs?

1015
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:53,969
Yeah, I have.
Yeah, I love 'em.

1016
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:55,403
And what do you think?

1017
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:58,240
Because she did such
beautiful things
when she started.

1018
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,610
She... She was totally
uncompromising.

1019
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,211
So strong.

1020
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,279
And then...

1021
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,882
But now
I'm writing a lot here.

1022
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:10,051
-Really?
-Yeah, and I'm painting
a lot too.

1023
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:13,221
And you think that you
found your voice here?

1024
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,025
You have something
to say here?

1025
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:30,572
Speak in English.

1026
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,843
In English. Naima is right here.

1027
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:38,914
-Susanna!

1028
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,821
Come on. I didn't want
to upset you.

1029
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,601
Ah! Well...

1030
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:04,840
One thing I was thinking about,

1031
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,308
you know, I belong
to a generation,

1032
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,211
we grew up without AIDS
and all these things.

1033
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,881
We could allow ourselves
a lot of things that these days

1034
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,950
young people cannot do.

1035
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:17,018
And you know
I'm a Mediterranean,

1036
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,555
and there is this tradition
in the Mediterranean countries

1037
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,057
that in the spring

1038
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:26,595
everybody used to gather
in the fields and just fuck.

1039
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:30,432
They thought that
that was what made
the earth grow.

1040
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:36,004
And I like to keep
that tradition alive, you know.

1041
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:40,041
-Mm.
-Sex is so enjoyable.

1042
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:45,013
And I think the reason why
is that it's so impersonal.

1043
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,481
It's not like love, you know.

1044
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,684
Like, you don't have
to be picking up
and, "I need you."

1045
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:52,387
No. It's more free.

1046
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,193
Sergio and I love
arguing about that.

1047
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,363
I hope you're enjoying her.

1048
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,340
Okay. Are you better now?

1049
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,615
So are you also
an artist, Naima?

1050
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:23,718
Uh, yeah, I'm an actress...

1051
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,053
mainly, yeah.

1052
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,554
She also plays the piano.

1053
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,356
She does?

1054
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,660
Yeah.

1055
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,993
Sergio?
I'm sorry, I forget the iPad.

1056
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:39,661
Sergio?

1057
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,038
Sergio?

1058
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,791
Thank you.

1059
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,027
Thank you, Naima.

1060
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:23,098
It's like something happened.

1061
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,533
I don't know what is it,
but it's like...

1062
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,603
my mind pfft.

1063
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,107
So, so beautiful.

1064
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:39,380
It's almost hard to touch you.

1065
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:41,716
It's like I'm like here
and it's like...

1066
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:44,819
hard to touch you.

1067
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,126
I've already started writing
a song about us.

1068
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,827
-Really?
-Yeah.

1069
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:55,830
What's it about?

1070
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,401
It's about you and me
falling in love
for the first time.

1071
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:04,205
But, like, we have invented
falling in love.

1072
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:08,376
You know? We invented it
and the rest just copied us.

1073
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:11,146
Like doing covers
of our falling in love.

1074
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:15,750
I'm sorry about the...
about the covers before.

1075
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:17,619
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

1076
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,725
Hug me.

1077
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:40,808
I gotta go pee.

1078
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,447
No, no, pee here.

1079
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,783
-Pee here.
-Pee here?

1080
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,419
I'll come be with you.

1081
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:01,629
I'll be right back.

1082
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:13,975
Oh, my God. Okay.

1083
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:27,789
Naima. Are you okay?

1084
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:30,959
Yeah.

1085
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,662
Okay. Sure?

1086
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,297
Yeah.

1087
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:37,999
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1088
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,038
You know what? For Christmas,

1089
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,842
Kathy and Faye, they're doing
a road trip for Europe.

1090
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,844
Road trip in Europe? Wow.

1091
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,480
We should go with them.

1092
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,717
Maybe.

1093
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:57,352
Maybe?

1094
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:59,020
Yeah, we still got, you know...

1095
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,090
It's in the future.

1096
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,691
We'll figure it out later.

1097
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:08,363
-Okay.
-Yeah. Okay.

1098
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,336
You've never, like...

1099
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,806
been with Kathy, or...

1100
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,542
or Faye before, have you?

1101
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:23,478
-Been with them? Yeah?
-Like?

1102
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,612
-Like?
-Physically.

1103
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,781
Like, have you had sex
with them before?

1104
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:27,949
-No.
-No?

1105
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,317
No.

1106
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:31,919
Why?

1107
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,357
I don't know.
I was just thinking, like...

1108
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:40,261
maybe they...
could come for like the...

1109
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:41,462
the end, you know?

1110
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,631
Like the last two hours,
or something like...

1111
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,168
I've never done an orgy.

1112
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,369
That would be fun.

1113
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:51,706
Do you wanna do an orgy now?

1114
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,778
I don't know.
I think it could be intr--

1115
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,347
I don't know.
I think it'd just be like
a nice book end.

1116
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:01,683
It could be really fun.

1117
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:06,421
I'll be right out.

1118
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,725
I don't wanna do an orgy.

1119
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:13,428
Okay.

1120
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,064
Okay. Let me pee.

1121
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:18,466
Okay. I mean,
let's talk about it.

1122
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:19,734
Yeah, let me just pee.

1123
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,403
-Yeah?
-Are you okay?

1124
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:24,339
-Yeah.
-Sure?

1125
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:26,040
Yes.

1126
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,742
-Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

1127
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,048
Sergio?

1128
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,750
What are you doing?

1129
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,624
Are you okay?

1130
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:20,361
Yes, I'm fine, Sergio.

1131
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:23,164
But I'd rather not be
in the bathroom.

1132
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:26,467
Can you let go
of the handle, please?

1133
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,837
Why do you want
to do an orgy?

1134
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,739
It was just an idea!

1135
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,608
I mean, we were trying...
I don't know.

1136
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,676
I don't think that seems
like the weirdest thing.

1137
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:39,213
You know,
it's just something new
that we could do together.

1138
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,782
I thought you would be into it.

1139
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,751
I thought it would
bring us closer.

1140
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,554
But that's it.

1141
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:48,890
I just want us
to be closer, Sergio.

1142
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:49,924
That's all.

1143
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,003
Sergio?

1144
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:07,942
Sergio!

1145
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,667
It's okay.

1146
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,572
It's okay.

1147
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,014
[Kathy] How are you?

1148
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:48,950
You seem good.

1149
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:50,384
Yeah.

1150
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:53,688
It's really... You know,
we have little naps,
but it's been pretty.

1151
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:56,190
-Yeah, well...
-Yeah.

1152
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:59,694
Have you guys done something
like this before, or...

1153
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,429
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

1154
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:03,164
I've, like, failed

1155
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,501
at it a few times.

1156
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:09,437
Seems like a good time.
I know it's midday, but...

1157
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,872
I prefer that.
-Yeah.

1158
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,773
It's so cliche
of, like, the night.

1159
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:14,275
I like to see everything.

1160
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:15,276
Yeah.

1161
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:18,779
So... are we on a timer?

1162
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,253
We can start.

1163
01:15:25,255 --> 01:15:26,754
We could just do...

1164
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,957
-the old hello.
-Mmm.

1165
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,696
-I love you.
-I love you.

1166
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:44,872
Mmm. Hi.

1167
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,179
Is it weird?

1168
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,684
Um...

1169
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,092
Hello. 

1170
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:12,627
Hey, are you okay?

1171
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:16,130
Hey, yeah.

1172
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,065
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I...

1173
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,602
Sorry about that.

1174
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:22,970
-No problem.
-It's okay.

1175
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:25,339
Come.

1176
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,109
Yeah, I just...

1177
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:30,277
got distracted.

1178
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,047
-Which happens.
-Yeah.

1179
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:34,682
I mean, I think it's...
-No, it wasn't.

1180
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:37,218
It had nothing to do
with you guys. I just...

1181
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,689
I'm really glad
you guys are here.

1182
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:45,526
Yeah.
-Because I think that...

1183
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:46,927
Because you guys
are close to Sergio,

1184
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:51,098
just, like, this has been
a lot for us.

1185
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,169
And I think that
if you guys stayed,
we could talk, like...

1186
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:56,871
We don't...

1187
01:17:56,873 --> 01:17:59,106
You know, what are we
really gonna offer?

1188
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,509
Right? I mean,
I just feel like...

1189
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,644
-I think just support.
-It would make sense
for us to maybe...

1190
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:04,779
I think support, though,

1191
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:07,581
and I think Sergio
maybe wants you here.

1192
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:10,384
I think we should all
talk about this together.

1193
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,753
-What do you think?
-Yeah. Do you want us to stay?

1194
01:18:12,755 --> 01:18:15,122
-Um... no, no.
-Yeah.

1195
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:22,863
I feel like maybe
you guys should,
um, just talk.

1196
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,131
-It's totally fine.
-Yeah.

1197
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,766
-We will talk later.
-I'm sorry.

1198
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:26,834
Don't apologize.

1199
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,369
-It's fine.
-Thank you.

1200
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:35,509
-I'm so sorry.
-No.

1201
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,078
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

1202
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,046
Will you call me later?
Yeah. Sure.

1203
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,281
Okay.

1204
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,499
I have to go to the bathroom.

1205
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:00,868
So do I.

1206
01:19:58,261 --> 01:19:59,827
-Say hi to my shit
right now.
-What?

1207
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,829
Oh, my God!
Is that your own shit?

1208
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,731
It's my own shit
in your fucking face.

1209
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:06,133
-How's that? How's that?
-Stop it! You're fucking crazy!

1210
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,301
Stop it!

1211
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,803
-Be honest!
-No!

1212
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,237
What are you--

1213
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,439
Oh, my God!

1214
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:13,808
Oh, my God!

1215
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:16,644
No! Stop it.

1216
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,846
What the fuck? Don't...

1217
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,915
-Okay, be honest.
-What do you want me to say?

1218
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:22,983
To say what you're thinking.

1219
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,752
I don't want to do this.

1220
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:26,387
I don't want to do any of this.

1221
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:28,255
You scare me, Sergio.

1222
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:30,324
Thank you.

1223
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,392
Thank you for being honest
for one fucking minute

1224
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,094
in 24 hours.

1225
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:35,429
Thank you!

1226
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,164
You're so fucked up.

1227
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,301
I have to take a shit
and put it in
your fucking face

1228
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,937
for you to say the things
as they are.

1229
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:48,409
I've been 24 hours
trying you to be honest.

1230
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,744
Being with you.

1231
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:52,546
Being real next to you.

1232
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:55,549
Why are you trying so hard?
I don't want you to.

1233
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:56,784
Because I fucking love you.

1234
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:57,952
How do you know?

1235
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,553
-Yes--
-No, you don't.

1236
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,288
Because it's fucking here!

1237
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,456
Because it hurts!

1238
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,191
Because it hurts so much.

1239
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,861
That's why I know.
It's fucking real, okay.

1240
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:09,129
-Stop.
-Okay? Stop, just--

1241
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:10,364
Stop!

1242
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,566
You have to stop.

1243
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,070
I don't wanna do it.

1244
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:18,138
I don't want to do it anymore.

1245
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:19,607

1270
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,177
Love you.

1271
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:58,645
Good night, good night.

1272
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,624
<i>  Ah! Sweet mystery of life </i>

1273
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:41,895
<i>  At last, I've found you </i>

1274
01:31:41,897 --> 01:31:47,033
<i>  At last I know</i>
<i> The secret of it all </i>

1275
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:08,788
<i>  For the longing, seeking</i>
<i> Striving, waiting, yearning </i>

1276
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,057
<i>  The burning hopes </i>

1277
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:16,730
<i>  The joy and idle tears</i>
<i> That fall </i>

1278
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:23,703
<i> For it's love and love alone</i>
<i>The world is seeking </i>

1279
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:29,543
<i> And it's love and love alone</i>
<i>That can repay </i>

1280
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:47,928
<i>  It's the answer </i>

1281
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:52,065
<i>  It's the end</i>
<i> And all of living </i>

1282
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:57,971
<i>  For it is love alone</i>
<i> That rules the day </i>

1283
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:04,077
<i>  Sweet mystery of life </i>

1284
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:07,547
<i>  Sweet mystery </i>

1285
01:33:07,549 --> 01:33:11,851
<i>  Sweet mystery of life </i>
